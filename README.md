Case Studies: Copy-Number-Aware Differential Gene Expression Analysis with *DeConveil*.

This repository contains case studies demonstrating the application and performance of the DeConveil computational framework.

The included studies cover:

1) Performance evaluation on simulated data — benchmarking DeConveil’s accuracy and robustness using controlled simulated datasets;

2) Application to TCGA aneuploid Cancer cohorts — testing DeConveil on real-world datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to assess its performance in complex aneuploid tumor samples.
